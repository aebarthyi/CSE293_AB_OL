# Final Project Proposal

Re-read the final project description, then answer the following questions.

1. Describe your project idea. Does it fall under an FPGA-focused track, SystemVerilog-focused track, or ASIC-focused track?
2. What IP is needed? Include links to any documentation or code examples.
3. What hardware do you need? Development boards, PMOD accessories, etc? (Within reason, I can request BELS to purchase any hardware that you would like).
4. Give a timeline for your goals. What do you plan on finishing for each of the checkpoints? Give yourself buffer.
5. List your team members, and describe what each of them will do.
