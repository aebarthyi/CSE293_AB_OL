# HW3 -- Impactful Community Contribution

Due Date: 3/14/2025. Groups of 1-2 allowed.

Having a portfolio of high-quality, publicly available resources and contributions can greatly grow your credibility and benefit the broader community. In this assignment, your goal is to make an impactful contribution to the hardware design community by creating an educational resource or contributing to an open-source project.

## Educational Resource

This option involves creating a high-quality resource related to VLSI, FPGA, Verilog, or any other hardware-related topic. Your resource should aim to assist others in the hardware design community and can be based on a topic you enjoy, found challenging, or believe would benefit others.

You may choose to share your resource publicly online or keep it private or anonymous.

Allowed formats include

* **Blog Post:** Write an informative blog post on a topic and host it on a GitHub repository.
* **Code Example:** Create a useful code snippet or template and post it to GitHub.
* **Video Explanation:** Record a YouTube video explaining a concept. This can include a PowerPoint presentation, animations made with Manim, or a whiteboard explanation (likely using OBS as a recording tool).
* **Other:** Propose an idea to me for approval if it does not fall under the above categories.

## Open Source Contribution

This option involves making a meaningful contribution to an open-source repository. Examples include fixing bugs in tools, adding features to existing IPs, or significantly improving documentation.

Possible Projects include

* Contribute to the [sky130_schematics project](https://github.com/sifferman/sky130_schematics) which organizes visual schematics for SKY130 cells. You can complete this homework assignment by creating 3 additional cells, including all sizings.
* Create a PR for [YosysHQ/yosys#4663](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/issues/4663) to create a Xilinx BRAM model that is compatible with Verilator and Icarus.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Relevance and usefulness of the resource/contribution.
